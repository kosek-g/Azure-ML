# Airline delays - building classification model using Azure ML

- This project utilizes Azure Machine Learning to build a classification model for predicting flight delays in the airline industry.
- Leveraging historical flight data, features such as departure time and weather conditions are analyzed to develop an efficient model.
- The project consists of three main notebooks:
  - Data Transformation: Preprocesses and prepares the historical flight data for model training.
  - Auto-ML: Utilizes Azure ML's automated machine learning capabilities for model selection and tuning.
  - Deployment: Demonstrates the deployment of the trained model for real-time predictions.
